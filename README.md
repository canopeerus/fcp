# fcp

A simple TCP stream based client-server system for sending files to multiple
clients. It's a toy project with no authentication,security,validation or
reliability checks. It's a simple file transfer program where the contents
of the input file from the server are simply transferred and written to a
new file on the client side.

Mainly written as a way to understand TCP and sockets and more importantly
to easily send files without mucking around with ftp or network shared
storages in a LAN.
